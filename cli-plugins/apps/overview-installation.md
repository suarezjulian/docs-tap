# Overview

This Tanzu CLI plugin provides the ability to create, view, update, and delete application workloads on any Kubernetes cluster that has the Tanzu Application Platform components installed.

## <a id='About'></a>About Workloads

The Tanzu Application Platform includes tools that enable developers to quickly begin building and testing applications regardless of their familiarity with Kubernetes. Developers can turn source code into a workload running in a container with a URL in minutes. 

A Workload enables developers to choose application specifications such as the location of their repository, environment variables, and service claims.

The platform can support range of possible workloads, from a stand-alone serverless process that spins up on demand, to one of a constellation of microservice that work together as a logical application or even a small hello-world test app.


## <a id='Installation'></a>Installation

Follow [these instructions](../../install-general.md#cli-and-plugin) to install the Tanzu CLI.

From the `$HOME/tanzu` directory run the following command:

```
tanzu plugin install --local ./cli apps
```

To verify that it was installed correctly run:

```
tanzu apps version
```
A version should be displayed in the output.

If the following error is displayed during installation:
```
Error: could not find plugin "apps" in any known repositories

âœ–  could not find plugin "apps" in any known repositories
```

Verify that there is an `apps` entry in the `cli/manifest.yaml` file. It should look like this:

```

    - name: apps
      description: Applications on Kubernetes
      versions: []
